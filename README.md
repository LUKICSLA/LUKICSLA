# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there
Hello!

My name is LukÃ¡Å¡ MaÃ¡r (I am also known as "Luki" or "Lukyy") and I am junior level designer and QA tester at [CSLA Studio](https://csla-studio.blogspot.com/). We are the creators of [CSLA: Iron Curtain CDLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294440/Arma_3_Creator_DLC_CSLA_Iron_Curtain/), mods [ÄŒSLA](https://csla-studio.blogspot.com/p/download.html) and [ÄŒSLA 2](https://csla-studio.blogspot.com/p/download.html) created for games Operation Flashpoint, ArmA: Armed Assault, and Arma 2: Combined Operations.

I'm a student of Applied informatics at the [Faculty of Natural Sciences of the University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in Trnava](https://www.ucm.sk/en/), Slovakia.

I have a passion for web development, information security, game development, programming, server management, computer networks, and hiking.
