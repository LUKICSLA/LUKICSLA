# 👋🏻 Hello there
Hello!

My name is Lukáš Maár (I am also known as "Luki" or "Lukyy") and I am a level designer and QA tester at [CSLA Studio](https://csla-studio.blogspot.com/) and a student of Applied informatics at the [Faculty of Natural Sciences of the University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in Trnava](https://www.ucm.sk/en/), Slovakia. We are the creators of [CSLA: Iron Curtain CDLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294440/Arma_3_Creator_DLC_CSLA_Iron_Curtain/), mods [ČSLA](https://csla-studio.blogspot.com/p/download.html) and [ČSLA 2](https://csla-studio.blogspot.com/p/download.html) created for games Operation Flashpoint, ArmA: Armed Assault, and Arma 2: Combined Operations.

In 2023, we, together with my supervisor, PaedDr. Mgr. Miroslav Ölvecký, PhD., wrote [a publication titled "The security of Laravel applications"](https://www.fpvai.ukf.sk/svk-2023/assets/documents/Zbornik_SVK_2023.pdf) (p. 243 - 248) for the Student Scientific Conference held at the Faculty of Natural Sciences of the UMB in Banská Bystrica.

I am passionate about web development, information security, game development, programming, server management, computer networks, and hiking.
